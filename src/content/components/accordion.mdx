The Accordion component provides an expandable/collapsible container that helps organize content into digestible sections, saving valuable screen space while keeping related information accessible.

## Basic Usage

Accordions are perfect for FAQs, product specifications, or any content that benefits from progressive disclosure.

<Accordion title="What is Once UI?">
  Once UI is a comprehensive design system and component library built for modern web applications. It provides a collection of reusable components, design tokens, and patterns to help developers build consistent, accessible, and beautiful user interfaces.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I install Once UI?">
  You can install Once UI using npm or yarn:
  
  ```bash
  npm install @once-ui/react
  # or
  yarn add @once-ui/react
  ```
  
  Then import components as needed in your application.
</Accordion>

## Customization Options

The Accordion component supports various customization options:

- **Size**: Control the overall size with the `size` prop (`s`, `m`, or `l`)
- **Icon**: Change the default chevron icon with the `icon` prop
- **Radius**: Adjust corner rounding with the `radius` prop
- **Initial state**: Control whether it's initially open with the `open` prop

## Custom Syntax

Magic Docs provides an AccordionGroup component for creating groups of accordions with consistent styling:

```tsx
<AccordionGroup 
  items={[
    {
      title: "First accordion title",
      content: "Content for the first accordion"
    },
    {
      title: "Second accordion title",
      content: "Content for the second accordion"
    }
  ]}
/>
```

Here's an example of the AccordionGroup in action:

<AccordionGroup 
  items={[
    {
      title: "How do I use the AccordionGroup component?",
      content: "Just pass an array of items with title and content properties to the AccordionGroup component. You can include any MDX content in the content property, including lists, bold text, italic text, and links."
    },
    {
      title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
      content: <Text>You can also use <InlineCode>custom components</InlineCode> to display in the accordion title / content.</Text>
    }
  ]}
/>

## Accessibility Considerations

Our Accordion component follows WAI-ARIA best practices:

1. Uses appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers
2. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
3. Maintains focus management during interactions

Accordions are a powerful way to organize complex information while keeping your UI clean and focused.
