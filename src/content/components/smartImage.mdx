The SmartImage component is a versatile media display solution that handles images, videos, and YouTube embeds with advanced features like zoom functionality, aspect ratio control, and responsive sizing.

## Basic Usage

SmartImage wraps Next.js's Image component and adds additional functionality. You can access it in an MDX file through the mdx image syntax or the custom SmartImage component if you need full customization.

## YouTube Embedding

You can embed YouTube videos directly using the same component:

<SmartImage 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyrILUldVP0" 
  aspectRatio="16/9"
  radius="m"
/>

The SmartImage component simplifies media handling while providing advanced features that enhance the user experience.
