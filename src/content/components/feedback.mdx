The Feedback component provides a consistent way to communicate status messages, alerts, and notifications to users. It supports different variants to convey different types of information effectively.

## Basic Usage

The Feedback component has four main variants: info, success, warning, and danger.

<Feedback
  icon
  variant="info"
  title="Information"
  description="This is an informational message for the user."
/>

## Variants

Each variant is designed to communicate a specific type of message:

<Feedback
  icon
  marginBottom="24"
  variant="success"
  title="Success"
  description="Your changes have been saved successfully."
/>

<Feedback
  icon
  marginBottom="24"
  variant="warning"
  title="Warning"
  description="Your session will expire in 5 minutes. Please save your work."
/>

<Feedback
  icon
  marginBottom="24"
  variant="danger"
  title="Error"
  description="There was a problem processing your request. Please try again."
/>

## With Action Button

You can add an action button to provide users with a direct way to respond:

<Feedback
  variant="info"
  title="New Feature Available"
  description="We've added a new feature that you might be interested in."
  actionButtonProps={{
    children: "Learn More",
    variant: "primary"
  }}
/>

## Implementation Example

Here's how to implement Feedback components in your application:

```tsx
<Feedback
  variant="success"
  title="Form Submitted"
  description="Thank you for your submission. We'll be in touch soon."
/>
```

## Best Practices

When using the Feedback component:

1. **Be specific**: Provide clear, concise messages that explain what happened
2. **Suggest actions**: When appropriate, tell users what they can do next
3. **Use appropriate variants**: Choose the right variant based on the message type
4. **Position strategically**: Place feedback where users will notice it without disrupting their workflow
5. **Allow dismissal**: For non-critical messages, provide a way to dismiss the feedback

The Feedback component helps create a better user experience by providing timely, relevant information in a consistent format.
