## Disable pages

Magic Portfolio's `RouteGuard` component takes care of conditionally rendering pages based on the `routes` object.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="6"
    codeInstances={[
  {
    code:
`const routes = {
    '/':        true,
    '/about':   true,
    '/work':    true,
    '/blog':    true,
    '/gallery': false,
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "resources/config.js"
  }
]} />

The code above will ensure that the `/gallery` page is not accessible and is not displayed in the navigation.

## Password protection

The `RouteGuard` component also takes care of conditionally rendering pages based on the `protectedRoutes` object.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    highlight="2"
    codeInstances={[
  {
    code:
`const protectedRoutes = {
  '/work/once-ui': true
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "resources/config.js"
  }
]} />

The code above will ensure that the `/work/once-ui` page is only accessible after providing a password. The password can be set in the `.env.local` file for local development and as an [environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) for production.
